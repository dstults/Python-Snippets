# Python-Snippets
 Just a few sample python scripts

I'm working on a [full tutorial](https://github.com/dstults/Python-Snippets/tree/main/Essentials) as I go back over everything.

There is a [spam-ham machine learning program](https://github.com/dstults/Python-Snippets/tree/main/Spam-Ham%20Analyzer), the metadata that goes with it is currently not included but once I can fish out some new data I will try to add it to the repository.
